Therefore, hydrogen is clearly one of the most common elements. For the electromagnetic radiation: Although the Sun's surface temperature (~5778K) means its peak emission is in the visible range (according to Wien's displacement law), when considering the total energy output across all wavelengths, the Sun actually radiates a significant portion of its energy in the infrared region. The Sun's spectrum extends well into the infrared, and this region contains a substantial fraction of the total radiated energy.
