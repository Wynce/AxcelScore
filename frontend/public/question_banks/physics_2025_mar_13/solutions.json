    "simple_answer": "The diameter of one ball is 4 cm.",
    "calculation_steps": [
      "Step 1: Identify the total length of 6 balls from ruler readings: 62 cm - 38 cm = 24 cm",

    "detailed_explanation": {
      "why_correct": "Option A is correct because the six balls span from 38 cm to 62 cm on the ruler (total length 24 cm), so each ball has a diameter of 24 cm \u00f7 6 = 4 cm.",
      "why_others_wrong": {
        "B": "5 cm would give a total length of 30 cm for 6 balls, which doesn't match the 24 cm measurement",
        "C": "6 cm would give a total length of 36 cm for 6 balls, which is too large compared to the ruler reading",
        "D": "8 cm would give a total length of 48 cm for 6 balls, which is far too large for the measured span"
