        "reasoning": "Since there is no air gap between either hotplate and the pan, direct contact exists in both cases. This eliminates convection as the primary heat transfer method because convection requires fluid movement (air or liquid). With direct solid-to-solid contact, conduction becomes the dominant heat transfer mechanism. Metal is an excellent thermal conductor, so the metal hotplate will efficiently transfer heat by conduction through direct contact with the pan base. While the glass hotplate's glowing heater does emit radiation, the glass itself will primarily transfer heat to the pan through conduction at the contact interface. The key distinction is that metal hotplates rely on conduction through the metal surface, while glass hotplates receive heat from radiation (from the glowing element) but still transfer it to the pan primarily through conduction at the contact surface.",

The key insight is that for a parallel-sided glass block, the light ray emerges parallel to its original direction but laterally displaced.

A fuse must be rated slightly higher than the normal operating current to prevent nuisance blowing during normal operation, but low enough to provide protection against dangerous overcurrents. Looking at the options: 3A, 5A, and 10A are all below the operating current of 11.25A, so they would blow immediately when the vacuum cleaner is switched on.

        "reasoning": "The gravitational field strength (g) at any point is given by Newton's law of universal gravitation: g = GM/r\u00b2, where G is the gravitational constant, M is the mass of the planet, and r is the distance from the planet's center. From this equation, we can see that: (1) The field strength is directly proportional to the planet's mass M - larger mass means stronger gravitational field. (2) The field strength is inversely proportional to the square of the distance r - as distance increases, field strength decreases rapidly. Atmospheric pressure is unrelated to gravitational field strength; it's a result of gravitational effects on the atmosphere, not a cause of gravitational field strength.",

        "reasoning": "The Sun's radiation follows a blackbody spectrum with peak emission in the visible range due to its surface temperature of approximately 5800K. From the diagram, we can see three major regions: P (visible light), Q (ultraviolet), and R (unknown). The electromagnetic spectrum in order of increasing wavelength is: gamma rays, X-rays, ultraviolet, visible light, infrared, microwaves, radio waves. Since Q is ultraviolet (shorter wavelengths than visible) and P is visible light, region R must be the next region in the spectrum with longer wavelengths than visible light, which is infrared. The Sun does emit significant energy in the infrared region, making this the logical third major component along with visible and UV radiation.",
