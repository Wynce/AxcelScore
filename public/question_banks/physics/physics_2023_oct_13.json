Therefore, a 900-watt microwave oven transfers 900 joules of energy every second. Options B, C, and D are incorrect because amperes, volts, and ohms are not measures of energy transfer rate.",

      "correct_answer": "C",
      "explanation": "Pressure is defined as force per unit area (P = F/A). A sharp nail has a much smaller contact area at its point compared to a blunt nail. When the same force is applied, the sharp nail creates a much larger pressure because the force is concentrated over a smaller area. This higher pressure allows the nail to penetrate the wood more easily.",
