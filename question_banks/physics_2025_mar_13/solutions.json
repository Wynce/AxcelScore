When an irregularly shaped solid is immersed in liquid in a measuring cylinder, the volume of the solid equals the increase in the liquid reading (displacement method). The mass must be measured separately using a balance. Therefore, you need the 'increase in reading after immersion' (which gives volume) and the 'mass' from the balance.",
