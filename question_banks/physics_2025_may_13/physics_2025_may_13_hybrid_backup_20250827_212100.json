Light from the Sun takes about 8 minutes to reach Earth, then would take 4 years to continue to the star, for a total of 4 years + 8 minutes one way, not a round trip of 4 years total. Statement 3: Incorrect - the nearest star to the Sun is Proxima Centauri, which is definitely within our Milky Way galaxy.

Iron, while present, makes up less than 0.1% of the Sun's mass. For radiation: The Sun behaves approximately as a blackbody with surface temperature ~5800K.
